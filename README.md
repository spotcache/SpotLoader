## üõ° Ad Blocker Functionality
This extension includes ad-blocking capabilities to provide an uninterrupted Spotify listening experience. Ads are blocked by redirecting ad-related requests to blank audio files. Here's how it works:

Ads are replaced with a silent, blank audio file (blank.mp3).
Key ad domains such as audio-ak-spotify-com.akamaized.net and audio-fa.scdn.co are targeted.
Implementation Details
The ad-blocking functionality is defined in the rules.json file using declarativeNetRequest rules, ensuring minimal impact on browser performance.
